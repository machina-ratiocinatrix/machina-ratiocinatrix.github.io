# Machina Ratiocinatrix
<pre>
  'Machina Ratiocinatrix' is a term used by Norbert Wiener in the introduction to his 
  book "Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine".

  Ratiocination is a sort of speaking, eliciting something probable from the fact 
  under consideration itself, which being explained and known of itself, confirms 
  itself by its own power and principles. — Marcus Tullius Cicero
</pre>

Machina Ratiocinatrix is an implementation of environment for multi-entity language games conducted by a human philosopher. It has been built for the purpose of exploration of known and yet unknown (but investigated in the process of the game) abilities of contemporary machines, imitating Abstract Intellect (AI).<br>

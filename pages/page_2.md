Utilize Bayesian probability for iterative updates:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Incorporate feedback with Bayes' rule:

\[ P(A | B_1, B_2, ..., B_n) \propto P(A) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(B_i | A) \]

For game theory, Nash equilibrium guides strategic choices:

\[ \text{NE:} \quad \pi_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq \pi_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \]

Explore meta-induction by adapting strategies based on opponents' past behaviors:

\[ s_i(t+1) = f(s_i(t), h_{-i}(t)) \]

Iteratively update strategies considering historical outcomes and opponents' strategies.

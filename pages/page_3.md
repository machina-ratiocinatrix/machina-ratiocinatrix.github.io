The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, is given by the following formula:

\[ f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]

Here,
- \( x \) is the variable.
- \( \mu \) is the mean of the distribution.
- \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the distribution.
